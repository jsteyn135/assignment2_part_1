# assignment2_part_1 : Google book api search  

### what it is?
  a website/web application that allows the user to search for books in the google books api. it includes the ability to search using a keyword and then browsing 20 pages at a       time backwards/forwards. you can see the book's title, authors, publishers, publish date, page count, print type, and thumbnail.  


  
### features?  
✔  removed \[, \], \" from the authors names  
✔  added thumbnail when it exists, and placeholder image when it does not  
✔  added 2 other data fields to the template   
✔  added next/previous page functionality   
✔  previous page button disapears on the first page   
❌ next page button does not disapear when on the last page of all the results (it should)(i didnt implement this and did not test it)    
✔  when searching a new keyword after already having searched something it now starts on the correct(first page)   

⚒ still  need to fix the buttons lol

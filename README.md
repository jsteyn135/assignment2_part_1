✔  removed \[, \], \" from the authors names

✔  added 2 other data fields to the template   
✔  added next/previous page functionality   
✔  previous page button disapears on the first page   
❌ next page button does not disapear when on the last page of all the results (it should)(i didnt implement this and did not test it)    
✔  when searching a new keyword after already having searched something it now starts on the correct(first page)
